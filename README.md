FEND Project 3: Classic Frogger Game
====================================

I completed this project for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.  The object of the game is to successfully
navigate the player from the grassy tiles, across the gray tiles, and to the blue tiles on the other side (all while avoiding the 
enemy bugs trying to run the player over).  

Play Instructions
-----------------

*Use the arrow keys to navigate the player: up, down, right, and left.

*Avoid the bugs.

*The game is won when the player reaches the blue tiles.

Game Setup
----------
*Download the game files from the repository.

*Open the `index.html` file to play the game.
